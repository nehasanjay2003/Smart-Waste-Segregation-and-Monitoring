# Smart-Waste-Segregation-and-Monitoring System
A Python-based smart waste management simulation that automatically segregates waste into recyclable and non-recyclable compartments, monitors bin levels in real time, displays status on a virtual screen, and generates intelligent alerts for warning, full capacity, and reset events.
# Key Features

 Dual-compartment waste segregation

 Automatic garbage level tracking

 Real-time on-screen status display

 Visual garbage level indicator

 Warning alert at 70% capacity

 Full-bin alert at 90% capacity

 Screen notification on bin reset

 User-friendly alert captions
# System Workflow

Bin levels are initialized to 0%.

User selects the waste type (Recyclable / Non-Recyclable).

Garbage is added to the selected compartment.

The system automatically updates the bin level.

Alerts are triggered based on thresholds:

70% → Warning Alert

90% → Full Bin Alert

The virtual screen displays:

Current waste levels

Visual level indicator

Alert messages

When the bin is reset, a reset confirmation message is shown.
